I had dreams of being a chef when I was young; now I create
software instead of gastronomic masterpieces. Despite this, I sometimes take
the opportunity to cook more ambitiously. In January, I challenged myself to a
small dinner party with some high-school friends.[^im-late]

## The Menu

{:.menu}

When deciding the courses, I started with the preperation method: sous vide.
It was a recent gift, and I wanted to use it for as much of the dinner as
possible. Duck breast benefits from the controlled sous vide cooking, and would
be a treat for my guests.

However, duck breast is very rich, so a good base was needed and a sweet
vegetable to round out the flavour profile. I settled on carrots for their
sweetness, texture, and colour (they are also known to be good sous vide). For
the base I teetered between potatoes or yams, but fell on a soft and buttery
potato purée -- the carrots were going to be plenty sweet. The potatoes would
be cooked sous vide in a solution of milk and butter.

Since the main course was three sous vide items, the starter and desert had
to be stress-free. My dad used to make a goat-cheese salad that I enjoyed as a
kid; I decided to attempt something similar, and while I was originally
planning to have it with arugula, we ended up with spinach (which still worked
great).

For the desert, a pot de creme seemed like a good idea; it's a fairly light
desert, which would be appreciated after the heavy duck breast and buttery
pomme purée. I settled on a classic lemon custard recipe topped
with a raspberry-white-wine jelly that we had made a few weeks earlier.

## The Planning

Getting everything on the table while still hot, with only one sous vide
machine and 3 sous vide preparations, was really an excersize in planning. I
spent some time planning out what needed to be done, and when.

To aid the planning process, I made calendar events for the time 
needed to:
- prepare the ingredients for each piece,
- cook the duck, carrots, goat cheese, and custard on the stove, 
- cook the potatoes, carrots, and duck sous vide,
- keep the  potatoes, and carrots warm in the oven
- cook the custard in the oven,
- keep the custard in the fridge to set. 

## The Day

I started just after lunch with the lemon custard, since it would need to chill
in the fridge for 4 hours after baking. This was by far the least stressful
course.

While the custard was baking, I prepared the ingredients for the pomme purée,
duck breast, and carrots.

As I started packaging equal parts potatoes and dairy fats into sous vide bag,
people arrived! Manuevering the weighty and floppy starch-sack made it
difficult to focus on conversations, adding to my stress. This plus finishing
up my custards and some tomatoes for the salad decreased my ability to
entertain. Finally I managed to get my guests a drink (moscato), as well as
some chips and chacuterie to munch on, but in the future I _definetely_ need to
incorporate snacks and music into the plan 😬.

With the guests happily drinking and eating, I finished the sous vide
preperations, and then things started going wrong.

## The Problems

- **Problem 1:** As the potatoes went into the sous vide, it quietly turned
  off! With the thin metal pot I was using, it quickly lost 20°C. 

  **Solution:** With the assistance of the burner on the stove, I brought
  temperature back up, (and insulated the pot with some aluminum foil).

- **Problem 2:** In addition to the water getting cold, there was still some
  air in the potato bag, so it started floating as it heated up. 

  **Solution:** With the help of some metal tongs, a small bowl, and a lid, I
  weighed it down and it stayed submerged.

- **Problem 3:** While manuvering the bag of potatoes back under the water, I
  punctured the plastic.

  **Solution:** Cry (not actually). By the time the puncture was discovered,
  only starting over would fix it (and I was too hungry for that).

Luckily I'd washed everything, but the potatoes ended up a little runny 😅 and
because the pot went cold they pushed dinner back by half an hour 😱. Using a
calendar allowed me to adjust the times easily when things started going wrong.

With the main course mostly-done, I only had to prepare the appetizer.
Initially, it was going to be plated 15-30 minutes into the duck's sous
vide time... but we served it right away -- people were getting hungry!

## The Meal

![JPEG image-53E2D1A43E65-1](/assets/images/food.png){:.inline .left .w30}

The salad was served with a Beaujolais (red wine, Gamay grapes, pairs well with
duck breast); however, some people were still drinking moscato, some beer. This
was a good opportunity for people to switch to the red wine before the duck
finished.

Once everyone was done the first course, we cleaned up a bit and went on a
small adventure to find a lactose beer that my friend recommended. When we got
back, the duck was ready!

After a quick sear, I served the sliced duck with [jus][jus-wiki] on a
bed (more like a puddle) of potato with some of the carrots.

Clean plates! We took a small break to clean up a bit and let people settle
(and play with the dogs).[^the-dogs]

The final course was a dream (the pre-preperation here was totally worth
it). The light lemon desert was refreshing after the heavy duck and potato
meal.

## Summary

Positives:

- Everything was cooked, and the duck was pink with a crispy skin. The carrots
  had good texture and flavour, and the potatoes tasted great. Nobody seemed to
  care or notice that they were runny.
- An easy-to-prepare appetizer allowed us to stretch out the eating time
  instead of waiting to start dinner.
- The lemon custard was delicious and really easy, which made the night move
  into a more relaxing tone.
- Fun with friends I hadn't seen in a long time. 

Lessons learned:

- Don't use metal tongs with plastic bags.
- Make sure the bags have very little air in them, even a little is enough to
  make them float.
- Get a metal mesh that can go in the pot, both to prevent things from resting
  on the bottom and to make it easier to lift things out of it.
- Use a more insulated pot when using large amounts of water.
- Watch the sous vide more closely for temperature fluctuations, **including to
  make sure it's on!**
- Rice potatoes into a large pot, be careful of spurts. Use a seive to pour out
  the liquid before ricing.
- Get a #50 seive to make the purée really creamy.
- Use less butter in the potatoes.
- The duck was a little tough, likely because it was cooked at too high of a
  temperature.

[^im-late]: I wrote the first-draft of this post shortly after hosting, but
    because of over-editing and then the pandemic, I lost steam. So, it's 6
    months late... oops.
