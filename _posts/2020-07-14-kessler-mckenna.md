Kessler and McKenna observed the importance of determining another person’s
gender in their work "The Primacy of Gender Attribution."

| When meeting someone: |
| :-- |
| 1. Assign the other persons gender |
| 2. Make assumptions based off of our assignment |
| 3. Retroactively justify the attribution of gender |
{:.inline}

They argue that we assign gender and make assumptions about people based off of
our assignment before all other actions, and that we retroactively justify our
attribution instead of making the attribution based on a defined
criterion.[^defined-criterion]

[^defined-criterion]: By defined criterion, I mean having some set guidelines
    in mind to determine someones gender. For example, seeing a beard and
    attributing manliness. Instead, Kessler and McKenna's work demonstrates 
    that we instinctively attribute gender (that person is a man) and then
    justify it later ("I attributed them as a man because of their beard").

    Think about what your thought process is when you see someone who's gender
    is ambiguous.

Identification of another’s gender is key for our understanding of their roles:
how to interact with them, what to expect from them, and how to interpret their
actions.

These roles and the primacy of gender attribution are taught through a
variety of social institutions, including religion, school, parents, etc. and
inform our actions from an early age. Kessler and McKenna note that when an
individual’s gender is perceived as ambiguous, other people often showed signs
of unease as they tried to place the individual into a gender
category.[^gender]

Notably, there is [some evidence][cgp-video][^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6] that many
(if not all) of our thoughts/actions are retroactively justified.

## Objectivity is a lie 

Many people subscribe to the idea that all things have an objective truth,
including the human experience. This notion uses the gender binary as a tool to
categorize people's experiences in an objective way. However, making these
assumptions and attempting to construct other experiences within an objective
view of reality is inherently flawed, since experiences are by definition
subjective and require interpretation from the perceiver.
