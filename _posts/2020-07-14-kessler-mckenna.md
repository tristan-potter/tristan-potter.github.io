titled ["Gender: Flip the script"][flip-the-script-post]*

Kessler and McKenna in “The Primacy of Gender Attribution” discuss the
significance of determining another person’s gender in encounters with others.


| When meeting someone: |
| :-- |
| 1. Assign the other person's gender |
| 2. Make assumptions based off of our assignment |
| 3. Retroactively justify the attribution of gender |
{:.inline}

They argue that when we interact with someone, we assign gender before most
other actions. We then make assumptions about how to treat that person based
off of our gender assignment, and retroactively justify our attribution and our
actions.[^defined-criterion]

[^defined-criterion]:This is in contrast to having some set guidelines in mind
    to determine someone's gender. For example, seeing a beard and attributing
    manliness. Instead, Kessler and McKenna’s work demonstrates that we
    instinctively attribute gender (that person is a man) and then justify it
    later (“I attributed them as a man because of their beard”).

As an aside, there is some evidence[^free-will] that many (if not all) of our
thoughts and actions are retroactively justified, but that is a topic for
another time.

[^free-will]: Studies done by [Benjamin Libet](wiki-ben) on consciousness and
    its impact on actions, as well as [studies on split-brain
    patients](cgp-video) have lead to some interesting findings.

This is important because the attribution of gender is key to defining Western
social encounters; it shapes how we interact with others, what to expect from
them, and how to interpret their actions. Gender attribution is such a strong
social cue that when an individual’s gender was perceived as ambiguous, Kessler
and McKenna noted that other people often showed signs of unease as they tried
to place the individual into a gender category.[^gender]

This presents a challenge for people who don't identify with the gender
attribution their parents made at birth. They may want to express cues to other
people to treat them differently, or so they treat themselves differently
(self-attribution). This may be particularly complex for people with identities
that don't fit into the normative blue and pink dichotomy of Western society.

These roles and the primacy of gender attribution are taught through a variety
of social institutions, including religion, school, parents, etc. and inform
our actions from an early age.

## Objectivity is a lie 

The gender binary also colours our experiences in a way that seems objective.
While many people subscribe to the idea that all things, including the human
experience, have an objective truth, experiences are by definition subjective
and require interpretation by the perceiver.

The gender binary is often used as a tool to categorize people’s experiences in
a way that seems objective. However, making gendered assumptions and attempting
to construct other peoples experiences within an objective view of reality is
inherently flawed, since experiences are subjective. Since our experiences
require interpretation, and specifically our experiences of gender, gender
attribution cannot be an objective reality.
