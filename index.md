tl;dr - I'm a **software developer** and **fashion student** based in
**Toronto, Canada**.

Since 2014, I've been working in the software industry, primarily in financial
services / commerce. I've had the privledge of working on some of the most
interesting and challenging projects in the industry!

While the work in commerce software was rewarding, I'm always looking for new
opportunities to learn and grow -- and at the end of 2022 I decided to focus on
another area -- fashion. This ultimately culminated in my decision to go back
to school in January 2024 to pursue a diploma in fashion at George Brown
College.

While I'm in school, I do consulting for small businesses and startups. If you
need help with your project, [let's talk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/twmpotter/)!
I specialize in:

- Engineering project and team management
- Custom web development (focussing on React front-ends and Ruby backends, but I'm flexible)
- Shopify site development and management
- Custom email marketing and automation

Whether it's tech, fashion, or something in between, I'm passionate about
building great products, on interdisciplinary teams. Particularly
relating to the ways that people interact and communicate.

If you need someone to design or build transparent and accessible systems, or
want to pick my brain on either industry, [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/twmpotter/)!

<!-- ## Software Developer -->

<!-- Since 2014, I've been working in the software industry, primarily in financial -->
<!-- services / commerce. I've had the privledge of working on some of the most -->
<!-- interesting and challenging projects in the industry. -->

<!-- These projects ranged from small startups to large enterprises (Shopify - which -->
<!-- in 2023 reported over 457 million buyers and over 1.75 million companies on the -->
<!-- platform), and collaborated on initiatives with Google and Cloudflare. -->

<!-- Many of the projects I've worked on improved revenue or the brand experience -->
<!-- for merchants: -->

<!-- - Speed improvements to sites which directly improved checkout rates. -->
<!-- - Headless customer accounts allowed companies like SKIMS to support customer -->
<!--   accounts across their mobile and web storefronts. -->
<!-- - New authentication methods and API's unlocked new capabilities for merchants -->
<!--   pushing the boundaries of what a web-store could be (Allbirds, Shogun, -->
<!--   Peleton). -->
<!-- - Technology that improved the rendering of images on web storefronts created -->
<!--   more appealing customer experiences. -->
<!-- - Created new services and processes which sparked conversations within -->
<!--   development teams, as well as within the broader commerce ecosystem. -->

<!-- ## Fashion Student -->

<!-- I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow -- and at the end of -->
<!-- 2022 I decided to pivot my focus to an area that I'd been interested in on the -->
<!-- side for while -- fashion. This ultimately culminated in my decision to go back -->
<!-- to school in January 2024 to pursue a diploma in fashion at George Brown -->
<!-- College. -->

<!-- I'm working on a few projects in the fashion space, and the intersection of -->
<!-- fashion and technology. If you're also interested in this space, I'd love to -->
<!-- [chat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/twmpotter/)! -->

<!-- ## What I'm interested in -->

<!-- Whether it's tech, fashion, or something in between, I'm passionate about -->
<!-- building great products. -->

<!-- I particularly enjoy working on interdisciplinary teams, solving multi-faceted -->
<!-- problems -- especially ones that involve the ways people interact and -->
<!-- communicate. -->
