When discussing the power of characterization and categorization it is important
to discuss the works of Michael Foucault, a French philosopher that is primarily
known for his ideas around the ways humans categorize things, and how that power
manifests itself in the ways people interact with each other. His work on
categorization and power structures is used in many fields including psychology
and sociology.

Our exploration of gender begins to concern Foucault’s when we begin to question
the ways that gender is a categorization of behaviour that influences how we
expect people to act and the ways that we act around others.

Without the concept of categorization, no mechanism of classification or
description would be present.

Given the importance of categorization as a method of describing differences and
communicating concepts, what does this mean for gender? Historically, Western
society recognizes two genders, which are rationalized using naturalistic
arguments. We can see in the historical record the factors and power dynamics
that lead Western society to settle on two, and the ways naturalistic arguments
were constructed to support this idea. Comparatively, modern theorists also have
records of other societies that use more than two categories, providing a
counter-example to any naturalistic arguments.

The way gender categories are formed in different societies is an area of
particular interest. Why is it that Western society continues to frame its
populations in terms of two genders, despite [growing

and gender queer people who did not fit into these categories?

The story of Western gender constructs is largely informed by the power dynamics
of society. The individuals in power have the power to manipulate the
categorizations we use, whether they be church officials like St Thomas Aquinas,
educators and popular philosophizes like Aristotle, or the people around us who
may rely our actions to an authority or someone whom we respect. As we are all
enforcing, attributing, and assuming each others genders, we are all partially
responsible for perpetuating and normalizing the ideas of gender that are often
perceived to be objective truths.
