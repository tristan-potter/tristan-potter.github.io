[Judith Butler][judith-butler][^judith-creds] builds off of
previous research to build a theory of gender as a flexible and changing
expression of the self, as opposed to a stable identity. 

## An ongoing performance 

In her model, our experience of gender as a stable identity is an illusion
built by repeated actions. Instead of being a stable part of someone identity,
she argues that is more useful to view gender as an expression of self that
changes.

The construction of gender (the act of performing a gender role) is used
to communicate with the people around us, in order to to signify our position
in a gender hierarchy and the roles that we take on. Our bodies (a politically
and socially regulated medium) are the essential prop we use to convey our
gender.

**Recap**: The perception of a concrete and objective gender reality is created
by the constructed story of gender that we perform, combined with the ways that
it is naturalized[^define-naturalism] and enforced by those around us.

## Appearance of naturalism and enforcement

As a society, we enforce these ideas regularly, often ridiculing or violently
subduing people who don't conform to the expectations of Western society. One
doesn't need to look far to see this; men who act too feminine are often
ridiculed and attacked, as are women who act too "manly".

Since it is essential to our safety and position in society, the performance
of gender must be consistent and repeated. Our
self-surveillance[^self-surveillance] and enforcement ensures both its
consistency and apparent naturalism[^define-naturalism].

> productions — and the punishments that attend not agreeing to believe in them;
> the construction "compels" our belief in its necessity and
> naturalness.[^gender-trouble]
> 
> *(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)*

The enforcement of gender, combined with the unconscious (or sometimes more
intentional) self-policing of our gender expressions, lead to the regular,
rigid, and predictable expressions of gender that make it seem biological.

[^self-surveillance]: Self surveillance is the act of monitoring and adjusting
    our own behaviour due to the possibility that another person might be
    watching.

    This is demonstrated in the architectural design of the
    [Panopticon][wiki-panopticon], which can be used as a metaphor for the
    self-consciousness of our current society.

[^define-naturalism]: Naturalism in this case is referring to metaphysical
    naturalism, which is the argument that a trait ["related to consciousness
    and the mind are reducible to, or supervene upon, nature."][wiki-naturalism]

    In this case we are making a distinction between a biological trait
    (nature) and a sociological one (nurture).

## What about "Born this way"?

Whether or not gender is a biological phenomenon or a societal/personal one
should not determine how we treat each other. Peoples personal realities and
subjective experiences are real for them, and we should listen and do our best
to understand each other regardless of our ability to explain or relate to
those experiences within our own personal realities.
